## Introduction üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The challenge we are addressing is the limited access to markets, training, and financing faced by smallholder farmers in developing countries, like Nigeria. Smallholder farmers are typically operating on a small scale, with limited resources and access to information, which often makes it difficult for them to increase their productivity and income.


Smallholder farmers often lack access to financing, making it difficult for them to invest in their farms and improve their production. This lack of financing can lead to a cycle of low productivity and low income, further exacerbating the challenges faced by smallholder farmers.

To address these challenges, we propose the development of Green Connect which is a mobile app that provides smallholder farmers with access to markets, training, and financing. The Green Connect will allow farmers to connect with potential buyers for their produce, access training on best practices for agricultural production, and apply for loans or grants to help them invest in their farms.

By providing smallholder farmers with access to these critical resources, we aim to increase their agricultural productivity and income, improving their standard of living and helping to drive economic growth in their communities.

4. A Loan module that allows farmers to apply for and receive loans for investments in their farms.

5. A keep note feature that provides farmers with insights on their farming operations, such as crop yields and costs, to help them make more informed decisions.

6. A weather feature that provide farmers with up-to-date information on the amount and intensity of rainfall in their area, helping them to make informed decisions about when to plant, irrigate, or harvest their crops.
